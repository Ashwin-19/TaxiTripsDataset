# Taxi Trips In Chicago

This project deals with enhancing the cab-booking preferences for both users and drivers in the city of Chicago. The arrival and departure of taxis is modelled as a stochastic (Poisson) process using the public dataset released by Department of Affairs and Consumer Protection, Chicago and statistical inferences are drawn.
